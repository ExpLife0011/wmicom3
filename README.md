When a serial device is connected over USB (such as the [Sparkfun ProMicro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640)) it appears as a COM port on Windows.

This wrapper will auto identify which COM port the specific device is attached to, given the device's hardware serial information.

WMI = Windows Management Instrumentation.
